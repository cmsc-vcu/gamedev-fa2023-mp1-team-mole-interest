Game Description:
In this game, the player controls as a star who has lost its friends. As the level progresses, the controls are introduced and smaller, multicolored stars can be collected. This adds to the counter in the top right of the screen, and when all of the stars are collected the counter changes to "Friends found!" to indicate there are no more collectibles to the player. At the end of the level, there is a portal, which if walked through when all the stars have been collected will take the player to the "good ending" end screen. If the player enters the portal without having all the collectibles, the player will enter the "bad ending" end screen. 

Project Details:
This is an entire Unity project, so to run it on your own machine you only need to download it and open the "My project" folder in Unity Hub. The game was made entirely using Unity's Visual Scripting graphs and other built in features, but no C# Scripts.
